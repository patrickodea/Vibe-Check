## Description

	What’s more popular than music? Not much. We wanted to focus our project around something that could realistically be useful and frequently used by everyday people. Trying to find new music or a new playlist is a common thing that people do. I see all the time on social media users asking others from music recs.
	Spotify already has playlists that you can find on their app, but they don’t have a spot where a user can actually input what genre they want and pick from multiple, descriptive playlists within that genre.
	This is the problem that Vibe Check solves.

## Usage

As a hip gen z, I want to be able to find different playlists in different genres to suit different moods.
